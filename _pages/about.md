I am Tiantian Li.  I obtained my master's degree at the [College of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering(CSEE)](https://csee.hnu.edu.cn/), [Hunan University (HNU)](https://csee.hnu.edu.cn/) under the supervision of [Prof. Gaobo Yang](https://dblp.org/pid/57/5520.html) in 2025.  I got my bachelor's degree at College of Information Enginnering from Sichuan Agricultural University (SICAU) in 2022.

📌My research interests lie in Neural Representation and Compression, 3D reconstruction and neural rendering, etc.
